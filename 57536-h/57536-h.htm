“Did I know Lincoln? Well,
I should say. See that
chair there? Take it, set
down. That’s right. Comfortable,
ain’t it? Well, sir, Abraham Lincoln
has set in that chair hours, him and
Little ‘Doug,’ and Logan and Judge
Davis, all of ’em, all the big men in this
State, set in that chair. See them marks?
Whittlin’. Judge Logan did it, all-firedest
man to whittle. Always cuttin’ away at
something. I just got that chair new, paid
six dollars for it, and I be blamed if I
didn’t come in this store and find him
slashin’ right into that arm. I picked up
a stick and said: ‘Here, Judge, s’posin’
you cut this.’ He just looked at me and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>then flounced out, mad as a wet hen.
Mr. Lincoln was here, and you ought to
heard him tee-hee. He was always here.
Come and set by the stove by the hour
and tell stories and talk and argue. I’d
ruther heard the debates them men had
around this old stove than heard Webster
and Clay and Calhoun and the whole
United States Senate. There wan’t never
no United States Senate that could beat
just what I’ve heard right here in this
room with Lincoln settin’ in that very
chair where you are this minute.</p>

<p>“<i>Come and set by the stove by the hour and tell stories and talk and argue</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>“He traded here. I’ve got his accounts
now. See here, ‘quinine, quinine, quinine.’
Greatest hand to buy quinine you ever
seen. Give it to his constituents. Oh, he
knew how to be popular, Mr. Lincoln did.
Cutest man in politics. I wan’t a Whig.
I was then and I am now a Democrat, a
real old-fashioned Jackson Democrat, and
my blood just would rise up sometimes
hearin’ him discuss. He was a dangerous
man—a durned dangerous man to have
agin you. He’d make you think a thing
when you knew it wan’t so, and cute!
Why, he’d just slide in when you wan’t
expectin’ it and do some unexpected
thing that just’d make you laugh, and
then he’d get your vote. You’d vote for
him because you liked him—just because
you liked him and because he was
so all-fired smart, and do it when you
knew he was wrong and it was agin the
interest of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell stories? Nobody ever could beat
him at that, and how he’d enjoy ’em, just
slap his hands on his knees and jump up
and turn around and then set down,
laughin’ to kill. Greatest man to git new
yarns that ever lived, always askin’,
‘Heard any new stories, Billy?’ And if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>I had I’d trot ’em out, and how he’d
laugh. Often and often when I’ve told
him something new and he’d kin’ a forgit
how it went, he’d come in and say, ‘Billy,
how was that story you’se tellin’ me?’
and then I’d tell it all over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was away a lot, you know, ridin’
the circuit along with some right smart
lawyers. They had great doin’s. Nuthin’
to do evenings but to set around the
tavern stove tellin’ stories. That was
enough when Lincoln was there. They
was all lost without him. Old Judge Davis
was boss of that lot, and he never would
settle down till Lincoln got around. I’ve
heard ’em laugh lots of times how the
Judge would fuss around and keep askin’,
‘Where’s Mr. Lincoln, why don’t Mr.
Lincoln come? Somebody go and find
Lincoln,’ and when Lincoln came he
would just settle back and get him started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to yarning, and there they’d set half the
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When he got home he’d come right in
here first time he was downtown and tell
me every blamed yarn he’d heard. Whole
crowd would get in here sometimes and
talk over the trip, and I tell you it was
something to hear ’em laugh. You could
tell how Lincoln kept things stirred up.
He was so blamed quick. Ever hear Judge
Weldon tell that story about what Lincoln
said one day up to Bloomington
when they was takin’ up a subscription
to buy Jim Wheeler a new pair of pants?
No? Well, perhaps I oughten to tell it to
you, ma says it ain’t nice. It makes me
mad to hear people objectin’ to Mr.
Lincoln’s stories. Mebbe he did say
words you wouldn’t expect to hear at a
church supper, but he never put no meanin’
into ’em that wouldn’t ‘a’ been fit for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the minister to put into a sermon, and
that’s a blamed sight more’n you can say
of a lot of stories I’ve heard some of the
people tell who stick up their noses at
Mr. Lincoln’s yarns.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, he used to keep things purty
well stirred up on that circuit. That time
I was a speakin’ of he made Judge Davis
real mad; it happened right in court and
everybody got to gigglin’ fit to kill. The
Judge knew ’twas something Lincoln
had said and he began to sputter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘I am not going to stand this any
longer, Mr. Lincoln, you’re always disturbin’
this court with your tomfoolery.
I’m goin’ to fine you. The clerk will fine
Mr. Lincoln five dollars for disorderly
conduct.’ The boys said Lincoln never
said a word; he just set lookin’ down with
his hand over his mouth, tryin’ not to
laugh. About a minute later the Judge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>who was always on pins and needles till
he knew all the fun that was goin’ on,
called up Weldon and whispered to him,
‘What was that Lincoln said?’ Weldon
told him, and I’ll be blamed if the Judge
didn’t giggle right out loud there in court.
The joke was on him then, and he knew
it, and soon as he got his face straight he
said, dignified like, ‘The clerk may remit
Mr. Lincoln’s fine.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, he was a mighty cute story-teller,
but he knew what he was about tellin’
’em. I tell you he got more arguments out
of stories than he did out of law books,
and the queer part was you couldn’t
answer ’em—they just made you see it
and you couldn’t get around it. I’m a
Democrat, but I’ll be blamed if I didn’t
have to vote for Mr. Lincoln as President,
couldn’t help it, and it was all on account
of that snake story of his’n illustratin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the takin’ of slavery into Kansas and Nebraska.
Remember it? I heard him tell
it in a speech once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘If I saw a pizen snake crawlin’ in
the road,’ he says, ‘I’d kill it with the
first thing I could grab; but if I found it
in bed with my children, I’d be mighty
careful how I touched it fear I’d make it
bite the children. If I found it in bed with
somebody else’s children I’d let them
take care of it; but if I found somebody
puttin’ a whole batch of young snakes
into an empty bed where mine or anybody’s
children was going to sleep pretty
soon, I’d stop him from doin’ it if I had
to fight him.’ Perhaps he didn’t say ‘fight
him,’ but somehow I always tell that
story that way because I know I would
and so would he or you or anybody. That
was what it was all about when you come
down to it. They was trying to put a batch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of snakes into an empty bed that folks
was goin’ to sleep in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before I heard that story I’d heard
Lincoln say a hundred times, settin’ right
there in that chair, where you are, ‘Boys,
we’ve got to stop slavery or it’s goin’ to
spread all over this country,’ but, somehow,
I didn’t see it before. Them snakes
finished me. Then I knew he’d got it right
and I’d got to vote for him. Pretty tough,
though, for me to go back on Little
‘Doug.’ You see he was our great man,
so we thought. Been to the United States
Senate and knew all the big bugs all over
the country. Sort o’ looked and talked
great. Wan’t no comparison between him
and Lincoln in looks and talk. Of course,
we all knew he wan’t honest, like Lincoln,
but blamed if I didn’t think in them days
Lincoln was too all-fired honest—kind
of innocent honest. He couldn’t stand it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>nohow to have things said that wan’t so.
He just felt plumb bad about lies. I remember
once bein’ in court over to Decatur
when Mr. Lincoln was tryin’ a case.
There was a fellow agin him that didn’t
have no prejudices against lyin’ in a lawsuit,
and he was tellin’ how Lincoln had
said this an’ that, tryin’ to mix up the
jury. It was snowin’ bad outside, and Mr.
Lincoln had wet his feet and he was tryin’
to dry ’em at the stove. He had pulled off
one shoe and was settin’ there holdin’ up
his great big foot, his forehead all puckered
up, listenin’ to that ornery lawyer’s
lies. All at onct he jumped up and hopped
right out into the middle of the court-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Now, Judge,’ he says, ‘that ain’t
fair. I didn’t say no sich thing, and he
knows I didn’t. I ain’t goin’ to have this
jury all fuddled up.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“You never see anything so funny in a
court-room as that big fellow standin’
there in one stockin’ foot, a shoe in his
hand, talking so earnest. No, sir, he
couldn’t stand a lie.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Think he was a big man, then?’
Nope—never did. Just as I said, we all
thought Douglas was <i>our</i> big man. You
know I felt kind of sorry for Lincoln
when they began to talk about him for
President. It seemed almost as if somebody
was makin’ fun of him. He didn’t
look like a president. I never had seen
one, but we had pictures of ’em, all of
’em from George Washington down, and
they looked somehow as if they were different
kind of timber from us. Leastwise
that’s always the way it struck me. Now
Mr. Lincoln he was just like your own
folks—no trouble to talk to him, no
siree. Somehow you just settled down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>comfortable to visitin’ the minute he come
in. I couldn’t imagine George Washington
or Thomas Jefferson settin’ here in
that chair you’re in tee-heein’ over some
blamed yarn of mine. None of us around
town took much stock in his bein’ elected
at first—that is, none of the men, the
women was different. They always believed
in him, and used to say, ‘You mark
my word, Mr. Lincoln will be president.
He’s just made for it, he’s good, he’s the
best man ever lived and he ought to be
president.’ I didn’t see no logic in that
then, but I dunno but there was some
after all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems all right now though. I reckon
I learned somethin’ watchin’ him be
President—learned a lot—not that it
made any difference in <i>him</i>. Funniest
thing to see him goin’ around in this
town—not a mite changed—and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>whole United States a watchin’ him and
the biggest men in the country runnin’
after him and reporters hangin’ around
to talk to him and fellers makin’ his pictures
in ile and every other way. That
didn’t make no difference to him—only
he didn’t like bein’ so busy he couldn’t
come in here much. He had a room over
there in the Court House—room on that
corner there. I never looked up that it
wan’t chuck full of people wantin’ him.
This old town was full of people all the
time—delegations and committees and
politicians and newspaper men. Only
time I ever see Horace Greeley, he came
in here to buy quinine. Mr. Lincoln sent
him. Think of that, Horace Greeley buyin’
quinine of <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Horace Greeley, he came in here to buy quinine</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“No end of other great men around.
He saw ’em all. Sometimes I used to step
over and watch him—didn’t bother him
a mite to see a big man—not a mite.
He’d jest shake hands and talk as easy
and natural as if ’twas me—and he
didn’t do no struttin’ either. Some of the
fellers who come to see him looked as if
<i>they</i> was goin’ to be president, but Mr.
Lincoln didn’t put on any airs. No, sir,
and he didn’t cut any of his old friends
either. Tickled to death to see ’em every
time, and they all come—blamed if
every old man and woman in Sangamon
County didn’t trot up here to see him.
They’d all knowed him when he was
keepin’ store down to New Salem and
swingin’ a chain—surveyed lots of their
towns for ’em—he had—and then he’d
electioneered all over that county, too,
so they just come in droves to bid him
good-by. I was over there one day when
old Aunt Sally Lowdy came in the door.
Aunt Sally lived down near New Salem,
and I expect she’d mended Mr. Lincoln’s
pants many a time; for all them old women
down there just doted on him and
took care of him as if he was their own
boy. Well, Aunt Sally stood lookin’ kind
a scared seein’ so many strangers and not
knowin’ precisely what to do, when Mr.
Lincoln spied her. Quick as a wink he
said, ‘Excuse me, gentlemen,’ and he
just rushed over to that old woman and
shook hands with both of his’n and says,
‘Now, Aunt Sally, this is real kind of you
to come and see me. How are you and
how’s Jake?’ (Jake was her boy.) ‘Come
right over here,’ and he led her over, as if
she was the biggest lady in Illinois, and
says, ‘Gentlemen, this is a good old friend
of mine. She can make the best flapjacks
you ever tasted, and she’s baked ’em for
me many a time.’ Aunt Sally was jest as
pink as a rosy, she was so tickled. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>she says, ‘Abe’—all the old folks in
Sangamon called him Abe. They knowed
him as a boy, but don’t you believe anybody
ever did up here. No, sir, we said
Mr. Lincoln. He was like one of us, but
he wan’t no man to be over familiar with.
‘Abe,’ says Aunt Sally, ‘I had to come
and say good-by. They say down our way
they’re goin’ to kill you if they get you
down to Washington, but I don’t believe
it. I just tell ’em you’re too smart to let
’em git ahead of you that way. I thought
I’d come and bring you a present, knit
’em myself,’ and I’ll be blamed if that old
lady didn’t pull out a great big pair of
yarn socks and hand ’em to Mr. Lincoln.</p>

<p>“<i>Aunt Sally, you couldn’t a done nuthin’ which would have pleased me better</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“Well, sir, it was the funniest thing to
see Mr. Lincoln’s face pucker up and his
eyes twinkle and twinkle. He took them
socks and held ’em up by the toes, one in
each hand. They was the longest socks I
ever see. ‘The lady got my latitude and
longitude ’bout right, didn’t she, gentlemen?’
he says, and then he laid ’em
down and he took Aunt Sally’s hand and
he says tender-like, ‘Aunt Sally, you
couldn’t a done nothin’ which would
have pleased me better. I’ll take ’em to
Washington and wear ’em, and think
of you when I do it.’ And I declare he
said it so first thing I knew I was almost
blubberin’, and I wan’t the only
one nuther, and I bet he did wear ’em in
Washington. I can jest see him pullin’
off his shoe and showin’ them socks to
Sumner or Seward or some other big bug
that was botherin’ him when he wanted
to switch off on another subject and tellin’
’em the story about Aunt Sally and her
flapjacks.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Was there much talk about his bein’
killed?’ Well, there’s an awful lot of fools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>in this world and when they don’t git what
they want they’re always for killin’ somebody.
Mr. Lincoln never let on, but I
reckon his mail was pretty lively readin’
sometimes. He got pictures of gallows
and pistols and other things and lots of
threats, so they said. I don’t think that
worried him much. He was more bothered
seein’ old Buchanan givin’ the game
away. ‘I wish I could have got down
there before the horse was stole,’ I heard
him say onct in here, talkin’ to some men.
‘But I reckon I can find the tracks when
I do git there.’ It was his cabinet bothered
him most, I always thought. He didn’t
know the men he’d got to take well
enough. Didn’t know how far he could
count on ’em. He and Judge Gillespie
and one or two others was in here one
day sittin’ by the stove talkin,’ and he
says, ‘Judge, I wisht I could take all you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>boys down to Washington with me,
Democrats and all, and make a cabinet
out of you. I’d know where every man
would fit and we could git right down to
work. Now, I’ve got to learn my men
before I can do much.’ ‘Do you mean,
Mr. Lincoln, you’d take a Democrat like
Logan?’ says the Judge, sort of shocked.
‘Yes, sir, I would; I know Logan. He’s
agin me now and that’s all right, but if
we have trouble you can count on Logan
to do the right thing by the country,
and that’s the kind of men I want—them
as will do the right thing by the country.
‘Tain’t a question of Lincoln, or Democrat
or Republican, Judge; it’s a question
of the country.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course he seemed pretty cheerful
always. He wan’t no man to show out all
he felt. Lots of them little stuck-up chaps
that came out here to talk to him said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>solemn as owls, ‘He don’t realize the
gravity of the situation.’ Them’s their
words, ‘gravity of the situation.’ Think of
that, Mr. Lincoln not realizing. They
ought to heard him talk to us the night he
went away. I’ll never forgit that speech—nor
any man who heard it. I can see him
now just how he looked, standin’ there on
the end of his car. He’d been shakin’
hands with the crowd in the depot, laughing
and talking, just like himself, but when
he got onto that car he seemed suddint
to be all changed. You never seen a face
so sad in all the world. I tell you he had
woe in his heart that minute, woe. He
knew he was leavin’ us for good, nuthin’
else could explain the way he looked and
what he said. He knew he never was
comin’ back alive. It was rainin’ hard,
but when we saw him standin’ there in
bare head, his great big eyes lookin’ at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>us so lovin’ and mournful, every man of
us took off his hat, just as if he’d been in
church. You never heard him make a
speech, of course? You missed a lot.
Curious voice. You could hear it away
off—kind of shrill, but went right to
your heart—and that night it sounded
sadder than anything I ever heard. You
know I always hear it to this day, nights
when the wind howls around the house.
Ma says it makes her nervous to hear me
talk about him such nights, but I can’t
help it; just have to let out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He stood a minute lookin’ at us, and
then he began to talk. There ain’t a man
in this town that heard him that ever forgot
what he said, but I don’t believe
there’s a man that ever said it over out
loud—he couldn’t, without cryin’. He
just talked to us that time out of his heart.
Somehow we felt all of a suddint how we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>loved him and how he loved us. We
hadn’t taken any stock in all that talk
about his bein’ killed, but when he said
he was goin’ away not knowin’ where or
whether ever he would return I just got
cold all over. I begun to <i>see</i> that minute
and everybody did. The women all fell to
sobbin’ and a kind of groan went up, and
when he asked us to pray for him I don’t
believe that there was a man in that
crowd, whether he ever went to church
in his life, that didn’t want to drop right
down on his marrow bones and ask the
Lord to take care of Abraham Lincoln
and bring him back to us, where he belonged.</p>

<p>“<i>He just talked to us that time out of his heart</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“‘Ever see him again?’ Yes, onct
down in Washington, summer of ’64.
Things was lookin’ purty blue that summer.
Didn’t seem to be anybody who
thought he’d git reëlected. Greeley was
abusin’ him in <cite>The Tribune</cite> for not makin’
peace, and you know there was about
half the North that always let Greeley
do their thinkin’ fer ’em. The war wan’t
comin’ on at all—seemed as if they never
would do nuthin’. Grant was hangin’ on
to Petersburg like a dog to a root, but it
didn’t seem to do no good. Same with
Sherman, who was tryin’ to take Atlanta.
The country was just petered out with
the everlastin’ taxes an’ fightin’ an’ dyin’.
It wan’t human nature to be patient any
longer, and they just spit it out on Mr.
Lincoln, and then, right on top of all the
grumblin’ and abusin’, he up and made
another draft. Course he was right, but I
tell you nobody but a brave man would
‘a’ done such a thing at that minute; but
he did it. It was hard on us out here. I
tell you there wan’t many houses in this
country where there wan’t mournin’ goin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>on. It didn’t seem as if we <i>could</i> stand any
more blood lettin.’ Some of the boys
round the State went down to see him
about it. They came back lookin’ pretty
sheepish. Joe Medill, up to Chicago, told
me about it onct. He said, ‘We just told
Mr. Lincoln we couldn’t stand another
draft. We was through sendin’ men down
to Petersburg to be killed in trenches. He
didn’t say nuthin’; just stood still, lookin’
down till we’d all talked ourselves out;
and then, after a while, he lifted up his
head, and looked around at us, slow-like;
and I tell you, Billy, I never knew till
that minute that Abraham Lincoln could
get mad clean through. He was just white
he was that mad. “Boys,” he says, “you
ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You’re
actin’ like a lot of cowards. You’ve helped
make this war, and you’ve got to help
fight it. You go home and raise them men
and don’t you dare come down here again
blubberin’ about what I tell you to do. I
won’t stan’ it.” We was so scared we
never said a word. We just took our hats
and went out like a lot of school-boys.
Talk about Abraham Lincoln bein’ easy!
When it didn’t matter mebbe he was
easy, but when it did you couldn’t stir
him any more’n you could a mountain.’</p>

<p>“<i>You’re actin’ like a lot of cowards. You’ve helped make this war, and you’ve got to help fight it</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Well, I kept hearin’ about the trouble
he was havin’ with everybody, and I just
made up my mind I’d go down and see
him and swap yarns and tell him how we
was all countin’ on his gettin’ home.
Thought maybe it would cheer him up to
know we set such store on his comin’
home if they didn’t want him for president.
So I jest picked up and went right
off. Ma was real good about my goin’.
She says, ‘I shouldn’t wonder if ’twould
do him good, William. And don’t you ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>him no questions about the war nor
about politics. You just talk home to him
and tell him some of them foolish stories
of yourn.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I had a brother in Washington,
clerk in a department—awful set up
’cause he had an office—and when I got
down there I told him I’d come to visit
Mr. Lincoln. He says, ‘William, be you a
fool? Folks don’t visit the President of
the United States without an invitation,
and he’s too busy to see anybody but the
very biggest people in this administration.
Why, he don’t even see me,’ he says.
Well, it made me huffy to hear him talk.
‘Isaac,’ I says, ‘I don’t wonder Mr. Lincoln
don’t see you. But it’s different with
me. Him and me is friends.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Well’ he says, ‘you’ve got to have
cards anyway.’ ‘Cards,’ I says, ‘what
for? What kind?’ ‘Why,’ he says, ‘visitin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>cards—with your name on.’ ‘Well,’
I says, ‘it’s come to a pretty pass, if an
old friend like me can’t see Mr. Lincoln
without sendin’ him a piece of pasteboard.
I’d be ashamed to do such a thing,
Isaac Brown. Do you suppose he’s forgotten
me? Needs to see my name printed
out to know who I am? You can’t make
me believe any such thing,’ and I walked
right out of the room, and that night I
footed it up to the Soldiers’ Home where
Mr. Lincoln was livin’ then, right among
the sick soldiers in their tents.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There was lots of people settin’
around in a little room, waitin’ fer him,
but there wan’t anybody there I knowed,
and I was feelin’ a little funny when a
door opened and out came little John
Nicolay. He came from down this way,
so I just went up and says, ‘How’d you
do, John; where’s Mr Lincoln?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Well, John didn’t seem over glad to see
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Have you an appintment with Mr.
Lincoln?’ he says.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘No, sir,’ I says; ‘I ain’t, and it ain’t
necessary. Mebbe it’s all right and fittin’
for them as wants post-offices to have
appintments, but I reckon Mr. Lincoln’s
old friends don’t need ’em, so you just
trot along, Johnnie, and tell him Billy
Brown’s here and see what he says.’ Well,
he kind a flushed up and set his lips together,
but he knowed me, and so he went
off. In about two minutes the door popped
open and out came Mr. Lincoln, his face
all lit up. He saw me first thing, and he
laid holt of me and just shook my hands
fit to kill. ‘Billy,’ he says, ‘now I am
glad to see you. Come right in. You’re
goin’ to stay to supper with Mary and
me.’</p>

<p>“<i>We went out on the back stoop and sat down and talked and talked</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Didn’t I know it? Think bein’ president
would change him—not a mite.
Well, he had a right smart lot of people
to see, but soon as he was through we
went out on the back stoop and set down
and talked and talked. He asked me
about pretty nigh everybody in Springfield.
I just let loose and told him about
the weddin’s and births and the funerals
and the buildin’, and I guess there wan’t
a yarn I’d heard in the three years and a
half he’d been away that I didn’t spin for
him. Laugh—you ought to a heard him
laugh—just did my heart good, for I
could see what they’d been doin’ to him.
Always was a thin man, but, Lordy, he
was thinner’n ever now, and his face was
kind a drawn and gray—enough to make
you cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, we had supper and then talked
some more, and about ten o’clock I started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>downtown. Wanted me to stay all
night, but I says to myself, ‘Billy, don’t
you overdo it. You’ve cheered him up,
and you better light out and let him remember
it when he’s tired.’ So I said,
‘Nope, Mr. Lincoln, can’t, goin’ back to
Springfield to-morrow. Ma don’t like to
have me away and my boy ain’t no great
shakes keepin’ store.’ ‘Billy,’ he says,
‘what did you come down here for?’ ‘I
come to see you, Mr. Lincoln.’ ‘But you
ain’t asked me for anything, Billy. What
is it? Out with it. Want a post-office?’
he said, gigglin’, for he knowed I didn’t.
‘No, Mr. Lincoln, just wanted to see <i>you</i>—felt
kind a lonesome—been so long
since I’d sen you, and I was afraid I’d
forgit some of them yarns if I didn’t unload
soon.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, you ought to seen his face as
he looked at me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“‘Billy Brown,’ he says, slow-like, ‘do
you mean to tell me you came all the way
from Springfield, Illinois, just to have a
<i>visit</i> with <i>me</i>, that you don’t want an
office for anybody, nor a pardon for anybody,
that you ain’t got no complaints in
your pockets, nor any advice up your
sleeve?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Yes, sir,’ I says, ‘that’s about it, and
I’ll be durned if I wouldn’t go to <i>Europe</i>
to see you, if I couldn’t do it no other way,
Mr. Lincoln.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, sir, I never was so astonished
in my life. He just grabbed my hand and
shook it nearly off, and the tears just
poured down his face, and he says, ‘Billy,
you never’ll know what good you’ve done
me. I’m homesick, Billy, just plumb
homesick, and it seems as if this war
never would be over. Many a night I can
see the boys a-dyin’ on the fields and can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>hear their mothers cryin’ for ’em at home,
and I can’t help ’em, Billy. I have to send
them down there. We’ve got to save the
Union, Billy, we’ve got to.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Course we have, Mr. Lincoln,’ I
says, cheerful as I could, ‘course we have.
Don’t you worry. It’s most over. You’re
goin’ to be reëlected, and you and old
Grant’s goin’ to finish this war mighty
quick then. Just keep a stiff upper lip,
Mr. Lincoln, and don’t forget them yarns
I told you.’ And I started out. But seems
as if he couldn’t let me go. ‘Wait a minute,
Billy,’ he says, ‘till I get my hat and
I’ll walk a piece with you.’ It was one of
them still sweet-smellin’ summer nights
with no end of stars and you ain’t no idee
how pretty ’twas walkin’ down the road.
There was white tents showin’ through
the trees and every little way a tall soldier
standin’ stock still, a gun at his side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Made me feel mighty curious and solemn.
By-and-by we come out of the trees to a
sightly place where you could look all
over Washington—see the Potomac and
clean into Virginia. There was a bench
there and we set down and after a while
Mr. Lincoln he begun to talk. Well, sir,
you or nobody ever heard anything like
it. Blamed if he didn’t tell me the whole
thing—all about the war and the generals
and Seward and Sumner and Congress
and Greeley and the whole blamed
lot. He just opened up his heart if I do
say it. Seemed as if he’d come to a p’int
where he must let out. I dunno how long
we set there—must have been nigh
morning, fer the stars begun to go out
before he got up to go. ‘Good-by, Billy,’
he says, ‘you’re the first person I ever
unloaded onto, and I hope you won’t
think I’m a baby,’ and then we shook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>hands again, and I walked down to town
and next day I come home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell you what he said? Nope, I can’t.
Can’t talk about it somehow. Fact is, I
never told anybody about what he said
that night. Tried to tell ma onct, but she
cried, so I give it up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, that’s the last time I seen him—last
time alive.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wan’t long after that things began to
look better. War began to move right
smart, and, soon as it did, there wan’t no
use talkin’ about anybody else for President.
I see that plain enough, and, just as
I told him, he was reëlected, and him an’
Grant finished up the war in a hurry. I
tell you it was a great day out here when
we heard Lee had surrendered. ’Twas
just like gettin’ converted to have the war
over. Somehow the only thing I could
think of was how glad Mr. Lincoln would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>be. Me and ma reckoned he’d come
right out and make us a visit and get
rested, and we began right off to make
plans about the reception we’d give
him—brass band—parade—speeches—fireworks—everything.
Seems as if I
couldn’t think about anything else. I was
comin’ down to open the store one mornin’,
and all the way down I was plannin’
how I’d decorate the windows and how
I’d tie a flag on that old chair, when I see
Hiram Jones comin’ toward me. He
looked so old and all bent over I didn’t
know what had happened. ‘Hiram,’ I
says, ‘what’s the matter? Be you
sick?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Billy,’ he says, and he couldn’t hardly
say it, ‘Billy, they’ve killed Mr. Lincoln.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I just turned cold all over, and
then I flared up. ‘Hiram Jones,’ I says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>‘you’re lyin,’ you’re crazy. How dare you
tell me that? It ain’t so.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Don’t Billy,’ he says, ‘don’t go on so.
I ain’t lyin’. It’s so. He’ll never come
back, Billy. He’s dead!’ And he fell to
sobbin’ out loud right there in the street,
and somehow I knew it was true.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I come on down and opened the door.
People must have paregoric and castor
ile and liniment, no matter who dies; but
I didn’t put up the shades. I just sat here
and thought and thought and groaned
and groaned. It seemed that day as if the
country was plumb ruined and I didn’t
care much. All I could think of was <i>him</i>.
He wan’t goin’ to come back. He wouldn’t
never sit here in that chair again. He was
dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For days and days ’twas awful here.
Waitin’ and waitin’. Seemed as if that
funeral never would end. I couldn’t bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to think of him bein’ dragged around the
country and havin’ all that fuss made over
him. He always hated fussin’ so. Still, I
s’pose I’d been mad if they hadn’t done it.
Seemed awful, though. I kind a felt that
he belonged to us now, that they ought to
bring him back and let us have him now
they’d killed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course they got here at last, and I
must say it was pretty grand. All sorts
of big bugs, Senators and Congressmen,
and officers in grand uniforms and
music and flags and crape. They certainly
didn’t spare no pains givin’ him a funeral.
Only we didn’t want ’em. We wanted to
bury him ourselves, but they wouldn’t
let us. I went over onct where they’d laid
him out for folks to see. I reckon I won’t
tell you about that. I ain’t never goin’ to
get that out of my mind. I wisht a million
times I’d never seen him lyin’ there black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>and changed—that I could only see him
as he looked sayin’ ‘good-by’ to me up
to the Soldiers’ Home in Washington
that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ma and me didn’t go to the cemetery
with ’em. I couldn’t stan’ it. Didn’t seem
right to have sich goin’s on here at home
where he belonged, for a man like him.
But we go up often now, ma and me does,
and talk about him. Blamed if it don’t
seem sometimes as if he was right there—might
step out any minute and say
‘Hello, Billy, any new stories?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes. I knowed Abraham Lincoln;
knowed him well; and I tell you there
wan’t never a better man made. Leastwise
I don’t want to know a better one.
He just suited <i>me</i>—Abraham Lincoln
did.”</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
